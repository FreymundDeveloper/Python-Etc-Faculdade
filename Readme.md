# Python-Faculty

Python applications and algorithms developed during college. Main applications:

* /PythonCodeListIPOO: Basic OOP algorithms in Python;
* /DAD1 and /DAD2: Structural data manipulation and formatting with Python;
* /Prog1 and /Prog2: Consuming and manipulating GUI libraries;
* /SOP: Using trading and data traffic control with Python;
* /Ros: Algorithms developed based on the ROSpy API.

OBS: Among all the applications in this repository, the one that stands out the most is "/Ros". It contains algorithms
based on robotics and sensor manipulation (both basic logic and fuzzy logic). With the vast majority tested practically
on rover drones and other hardware.
